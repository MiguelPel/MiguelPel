            <li onclick="makeAppear('oikodomikes')">Οικοδομικές άδιες</li>

            <p class="hidden" id="oikodomikes">You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we turned on
                each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't
                hold a candle to man. </p>

            <li onclick="makeAppear('taktopoiisi')">Τακτοποίηση αυθαιρέτων</li>

            <p class="hidden" id="taktopoiisi">Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass,
                'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?</p>

            <li onclick="makeAppear('adeies')">Άδειες λειτουργίας</li>

            <p class="hidden" id="adeies">The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his
                brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance
                upon thee.</p>

            <li onclick="makeAppear('architaktoniki')">Αρχιτακτονική μελέτη</li>

            <p class="hidden" id="architaktoniki">Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too
                fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

            <li onclick="makeAppear('epivlepsi')">Επίβλεψη εργοταξίου</li>

            <p class="hidden" id="epivlepsi">Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun
                in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>

            <li onclick="makeAppear('diamorfoseis')">Διαμορφώσεις εξωτερικών και εσωτερικών χώρων</li>

            <p class="hidden" id="diamorfoseis">Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some pilots get
                picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

            <li onclick="makeAppear('schediasmos')">Σχεδιασμός επίπλων και αντικειμένων</li>

            <p class="hidden" id="schediasmos">Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you and
                me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>
